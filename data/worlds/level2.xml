		OK, great work. The first step in our plan is to get onto the campus of Duckland University. The problem is, you need a certain number of Quacker followers to be allowed in.

		I figure that we can do an advertisement campaign to get some Quacker followers, but we'll need some money to do that. And we currently have none.

		That brings us here - the Donation Center. This is where ducks can donate their money to help Ducky. Do you think we could ... borrow ... some of it?

		Don't worry about if it's legal - once Ducky hears our message, he'll understand. And we'll return the coins back at the end!
