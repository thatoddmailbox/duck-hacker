	<mission goal="Get the security guard to open the gate.">
		Finally, we've found the records building! We've sent a crew to try and get inside. But there's a gate at the front, blocking the entrance.

		That's where you come in. This is the Duckland University Security room. The guard can talk over the intercom and ask for the gate to be opened.

		But how can you convince him to do that?
