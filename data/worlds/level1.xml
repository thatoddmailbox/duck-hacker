	<mission goal="Tell Featherwing's DuckBot what 1 + 1 equals.">
		Hi there. I'm Featherwing, and as you've heard, I've got an important message for Ducky. To deliver it, I'm going to first become a grasshopper deliveryman.

		That job normally requires a lot of training. But if we can get into Duckland University's records, we can edit them so that it looks like I already have the training.

		Anyways, we'll talk more about the plan later. First, you've got to learn how to program DuckBots.

		Here's a simple task. Move over to my DuckBot and say hello. (Make sure you're facing towards it!) Then it'll ask you a simple math question. Answer it and you're done.

		Think you're up to it?
