		Alright, the first thing you gotta learn is how to program DuckBots. Most ducks these days never learn this - they just use pre-made DuckBots. Disgusting.

		Here's a simple task. Move over to my DuckBot and say hello. Then it'll ask you a simple math question. That's it.

		Think you're up to it?
